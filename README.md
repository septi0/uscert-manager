For a sample configuration file see `config.sample.conf` file. Aditionally, you can copy the file to `/etc/uscert-manager/config.conf`, `/etc/opt/uscert-manager/config.conf` or `~/.config/uscert-manager/config.conf` (or where you want as long as you provide the `--config-dir` parameter) and adjust the values to your needs.

## Systemd service

To run UsCert-Manager as a service, have it start on boot and restart on failure, create a systemd service file in `/etc/systemd/system/uscert-manager.service` and copy the content from `uscert-manager.sample.service` file, adjusting the `ExecStart` parameter based on the installation method.

After that, run the following commands:

```
systemctl daemon-reload
systemctl enable uscert-manager.service
systemctl start uscert-manager.service
```
